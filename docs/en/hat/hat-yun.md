## Description

**YUN HAT** is a cloud-shaped multi-function environment information acquisition base. Built-in temperature and humidity sensor **SHT20**, air pressure sensor **BMP280**, photoresistor. 14 RGB LEDs. Embedded** STM32F030F4** control chip, providing a simple and efficient program call interface. Exquisite design appearance, accurate data acquisition of accurate environment and a certain decorative effect.

The base is designed for the M5StickC, and the same number of pins and spaces can be perfectly inserted into the expansion port on the top of the M5StickC. The overall structure adopts a three-layer design, and the upper and lower PCB boards serve as fixed structure and main circuit respectively, which is beneficial to the circuit. For long hours of work, the board also provides an independent external power interface. The middle layer is a light-guided acrylic component, which does not achieve a better light display effect. The acrylic outer contour cutting surface is partially polished, and the purpose is to program the control light. Effectively reduce the scattering of light, making it evenly saturated with light effects. One hook hole and two 6*4mm magnet mounting positions are reserved on the board, so users can easily install it in any corner of life.
