## Description

**SG90 servo** is a M5Stack custom 9g servo.The angle of rotation is 0Â°~180Â°ï¼Œit can be used with 8Servos HAT and PuppyC.This small servo is very easy to use for beginners.
You don't have to use a dedicated drive board with feedback control and a complicated gearboxï¼ŒAny common servo driver and microcontroller can easily turn it up.Compared to driving
a stepper motor, it is much simpler to use. You can use it to do some interesting small projects and control some angles.The commonly used pulse width is 1-2ms, 0Â° position (1.5ms),
-90Â° position (1ms), 90Â° position (2ms) beyond the pulse width range will damage the servo.If you feel that the cable is not long enough, you can purchase the servo extension cable to extend it.
 Yellow is the signal cable, brown is the ground wire, and the red color is 5V. Pay attention to the supply current and voltage to prevent it from being burned.
