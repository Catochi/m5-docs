## Description

**M5Stick-V RISC-V AI Camera**

### General Description 
M5Stack recently launched the new AIOT(AI+IOT) Camera powered by Kendryte K210 -an edge computing system-on-chip(SoC) with dual-core 64bit RISC-V CPU and state-of-art neural network processor.
<br><br>
M5stick-V AI Camera features its integration with machine vision capabilities, featuring the unprocessed acceptability to AI Visioning with high energy efficiency and low cost. We co-oped with Sipeed providing the MicroPython environment makes programming onM5stick-V easier.
<br><br>
The module comes with the OmniVision OV7740 sensor, using the OmniPixel¬Æ3-HS technology, providing a best-in-class low light sensitivity, making it ideal for machine vision. In addition to an OV7740 sensor, M5stick-V features more hardware resources such as a speaker with built-in I2S Class-D DAC, MEMS Microphone, IPS screen, 6-axis IMU, 200mAh Li-po battery, and more. 
<br><br>
More than the visioning, M5stick-V also features the embedded APU - Audio Processor. With its hardware beam-forming support and dual 512-point FFT units, the M5stick-V is also capable of a series of machine hearing works like voice wake-up to speech recognition.
