## Description

**FACES Kit** is a feast of functional panels, contains the most commonly used panels and keyboards with **MEGA328** processor inside, communication protocol through IIC(0x08) as slave mode. With these 3 different panels, it will be very easy to support keyboard interaction with your M5Core.

### GameBoy Keyboard
If you up for some classic video game, GameBoy panel plus M5Core is the perfect combination. All you need to do is upload an game simulator onto M5 controller, and attach the GameBoy panel underneath. this is how it looks:

### NOTE
**<mark>Notice1</mark>**
*The [Gray](zh_CN/core/gray) M5core is included in the FACES Kit. Similarly, other versions of M5Core can be stacked on the base of the FACES. The following picture is a comparison of their main differences.*

**<mark>Notice2ï¼šM5PORT EXPLAIN</mark>**<br>
*You can identify the port name and function by its color, red is PortA(21/22) mainly used for I2C, black is PortB(26/36) which can be used for AD/DA, Singel-bus communication, Blue is PortC(16/17) can be used for Uart. Correspondingly, most of the M5 Units have the Port with matched color for specify which port it should go in on the M5Core. 
Those port identification is a convenience for UIFlow (Blockly)  Users. For advanced using ,you can do you own customization, since most of the PIN on ESP32 are remapping-able.
Unfortunatly, PortA(red) can not be used as analog read in. It refers to GPIO 21 & 22 from ESP32, which doesn't have AD channel alternatives: <br>
<img src="assets/img/product_pics/core/basic/basic_notice_01.jpg"><br>
To use AD read function : 
1, Use Dupont cable refers to the pins on the side which can be used as an AD channel.
2, Get a M5GO bottom, which comes with a PortB.
3, Get a PbHUB and connect it with PortA, then you can have 6 PortBs.
For more information about Pin assignment and Pin Remapping, Please refer to EPS32 Datasheet*

The error message displayed on the screen, is actually normal, it doesn't mean something wrong with the hardware, don't worry. <br>
