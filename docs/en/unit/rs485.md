## Description

**RS485** is a TTL to RS485 convertor.

RS485 is a standard defining the electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in serial communications systems, widely used in industrial field. multipoint systems are supported.

used for converting TTL level to RS485 level. If the device to be controlled only can communicate with other device through RS485, you can connect this device with M5Core through this unit. In this case, you could easily control a RS485 device with [UIFlow](http://flow.m5stack.com).

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner, and each product page has a product-related case program for EasyLoader.

>2.After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer via the data cable, select the port parameters, and click **"Burn"** to start burning.

!>3.The CP210X (USB driver) needs to be installed before the EasyLoader is burned. [Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/establish_serial_connection)
