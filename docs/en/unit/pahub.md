## Description

**PaHUB**, is a expander for I2C GROVE PORTA(red port on M5Core). 1-to-6. If you want connect mutiple I2C slave devices and some of them may sharing the same address, this unit can resolve I2C address conflicts.

At the Unit PaHUB's heart is an **TCA9548A** produced by TI. The TCA9548A device has eight bidirectional translating switches that can be controlled through the I2C bus. The SCL/SDA upstream pair fans out to downstream pairs, or channels. Any individual SCn/SDn channel or combination of channels can beselected, determined by the contents of the
programmable control register.

Technically this Unit allows mutiple levels of nesting, for example you can wire PaHUBs to the root PaHUB to get more seats for your I2C slave devices, if you have 7 of them you can have up to 36 I2C GROVE ports, which makes it easier to get your project more organized.

The I2C address of this unit is 0x70 (changable by resistors).

*Notice: Please pay attention to the channel order while programing*

## Schematic

## Learn 
- The connections of the I2C data path are controlled by the same I2C master device that is switched tocommunicate with multiple I2C slaves. After the successful acknowledgment of the slave address (hardwareselectable by A0, A1, and A2 pins), a single 8-bit control register is written to or read from to determine the selected channels.

### Mini Burner

>1.Mini Burner is a simple and fast program burner, and each product page has a product-related case program for Mini Burner.
[Click here to download](https://m5stack.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/MiniBurner/Unit/MiniBurner_PaHUB.exe)

>2.After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer via the data cable, select the port parameters, and click **"Burn"** to start burning.

!>3.The CP210X (USB driver) needs to be installed before the Mini Burner is burned. [Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/establish_serial_connection)

  Wire.beginTransmission(PAHUB_ADDR);
  Wire.write(ports&0x3f);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
}


//Hub range is 0 to 5
void portselect(uint8_t i) {
  if (i > 7) return;
  
  Wire.beginTransmission(PAHUB_ADDR);
  Wire.write(1 << i);
  Wire.endTransmission(); 
}
