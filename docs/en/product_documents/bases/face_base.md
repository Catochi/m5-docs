When you are working on a project need a QWERTY for input, you just need to stack QWERTY keyboard on FACE Base. When you are working on a calculating project, you just need to change QWERTY to Calculator. You can event program FACE Kit through [M5Cloud](http://cloud.m5stack.com)(**MicroPython**) after burnning `M5Cloud` firmware. In the near future, you can program it through [M5Flow](http://flow.m5stack.com) platform.

The URL of M5Cloud is [http://cloud.m5stack.com](http://cloud.m5stack.com) or [http://io.m5stack.com](http://io.m5stack.com).

Absolutely, there are some expanding gpio of M-Bus at the back of FACE Base. Each expanding gpio is expanded as pin and port for convenience and flexibility.

FACE Kit can be pocket computer because a Battery(650mAh) has been built in the FACE Base. Surely, when the battery has been low-power, you can charge it by put it on a charge base.
