# Introducing variables
________________________

#### What is a variable?

>A variable is like a container. We can give the variable a name, use it to store the data, read it, or change it. It is often used in actual programming.

#### Create variable

>Click the Create variable option, enter the name of the variable, click OK to create

#### Using variables

>For example: assign the variable initial value A=6, and add the variable 2 after one second.

# Basic operation
__________________________

#### Function Description

>There are some basic arithmetic blocks in Math, such as "addition, subtraction, multiplication and division".

><img src="/image/Operation/Math.jpg" width="30%"> 

>* __constant__
Fill in any number and connect to other objects for assignment

>* __Common operation__
Add data on both sides of the expression to add, subtract, multiply and divide power

>* __Surplus__
Add data on both sides of the expression to make the remainder

>* __Special number judgment__
Add a value to set whether the judgment is true (for example, whether it is odd or even or prime), if it is true, it is True, otherwise it is False.

>* __Array calculation__
Summing an array, calculating the maximum or minimum, the average, etc.


#### Instructions

>Add data to both sides of the expression, assign the expression to a variable or other object, and get the result.

# random number
__________________________

#### Function Description

>When making games or animations, we sometimes need some random elements, and Random can generate random numbers according to our needs.

>* __random fraction__
Randomly generate a number between 0 and 1 each time it is executed

>* __random integer__
Specify a random range, each time it is executed, randomly generate an integer in the range


#### Instructions

>Set a random range with a constant and assign a random intger to a variable

# Introducing an array
__________________________
#### Function Description
>If the variable is a container, the array is a collection of many containers. We can assign values to any of the variables in the array.
><img src="/image/Operation/List.jpg" width="70%"> 
>* __length of__
Measure the length of the array (ie the number of elements in the array)
>* __X is empty__
Determine whether an array is empty. When it is established, the expression is True, otherwise it is False.
>* __in list find__
Array index, indexed positive or reverse specified element
>* __create empty list__
Add a value to set whether the judgment is true (for example, whether it is odd or even or prime), if it is true, it is True, otherwise it is False.
>* __create list with__
Customize an array

    
#### Instructions
>Add a create list to create an array, add some elements to the array, call iteratively or otherwise
