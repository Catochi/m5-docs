## Description

The <mark>LoRa</mark> Module is a module with small LoRa module named Ra-02.
You can program it after connected to any series of M5Stack Core through
Blockly, Arduino or MicroPython.

M5Stack LoRa Module can be used for ultra-long distance spread spectrum
communication, and compatible FSK remote modulation and demodulation
quickly, to solve the traditional wireless design can not take into
account the distance, anti-interference and power consumption

## Feature

-  LoRa Module named RA-02 supply by Ai-Thinker
-  Supports FSK, GFSK, MSK, GMSK, LoRa â„¢ and OOK modulation modes
-  Receive sensitivity as low as -141 dBm
-  Programmable bit rate up to 300Kbps
-  Build-in Antenna

## Include

-  1x M5Stack LoRa Module

## Applications

-  Automatic meter reading
-  Home building automation
-  Remote irrigation system

?> **Note** If your board LCD can't display or has some other problem, we suggest
you to add the two statements code followed by ``m5.begin();`` as shown
below
```cpp
    pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
    m5.begin();
```
?> **Note** Because GPIO5 who has connected NSS pin of LoRa module need be pull-up
at the moment your board(or system) power on to prevent system's LCD
can't display.
