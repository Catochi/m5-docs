# M5Stack LORA Module

## DESCRIPTION

The <mark>LoRa</mark> Module is a module with small LoRa module named Ra-02.
You can program it after connected to any series of M5Stack Core through
Blockly, Arduino or MicroPython.

M5Stack LoRa Module can be used for ultra-long distance spread spectrum
communication, and compatible FSK remote modulation and demodulation
quickly, to solve the traditional wireless design can not take into
account the distance, anti-interference and power consumption

?> **Note** If your board LCD can't display or has some other problem, we suggest
you to add the two statements code followed by ``m5.begin();`` as shown
below
```cpp
    m5.begin();
    pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
```
?> **Note** Because GPIO5 who has connected NSS pin of LoRa module need be pull-up
at the moment your board(or system) power on to prevent system's LCD
can't display.
